      <h2 class="title">Prologue</h2>

      <p>Dorothy Hausmann had never been in a cannabis dispensary before. The walls were too white, the lighting too bright, like an Apple store had merged with a pharmacy. Her daughter Rachel walked ahead, confident in this space, greeting the security guard by name.</p>

      <p>"Mom, stop looking like you're buying heroin," Rachel whispered, squeezing her mother's hand. "This is legal. This is medicine."</p>

      <p>Dorothy nodded, clutching her purse. Two days since Whiskers died. Fourteen years of that cat greeting her every morning, and now just an empty food dish she couldn't bring herself to wash. The Xanax her doctor prescribed sat untouched—she'd seen what benzos did to her sister.</p>

      <p>"This is natural," Rachel was saying, pointing at amber gummies in childproof containers. "From plants. TR Cannabis—they're local, super reputable. Their products helped me through my dissertation anxiety."</p>

      <p>The budtender, a young man with kind eyes, explained dosages with practiced patience. "First time? Start with 2.5 milligrams. You can always take more, but you can't take less."</p>

      <p>Dorothy bought the smallest package. Ten gummies, 5mg each. Rachel showed her how to bite them in half. "Quarter for mild relaxation, half if you really need to sleep. Wait two hours before taking more—edibles sneak up on you."</p>

      <p>In the parking lot, Dorothy hugged her daughter. "Thank you for not judging your old mother."</p>

      <p>"Text me when you get home," Rachel said. "Let me know how you feel."</p>

      <div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

      <p>Dorothy's house in Grosse Pointe was too quiet. Whiskers' litterbox still sat in the laundry room. His favorite toy—a felt mouse missing one ear—lay under the coffee table. She'd clean tomorrow. Tonight, she just needed to not think.</p>

      <p>She examined the gummy under the kitchen light. It looked like candy her grandchildren would eat. Smelled vaguely of artificial watermelon. She bit it in half, then reconsidered and took the whole thing. Five milligrams. The package said "mild relaxation."</p>

      <p>She settled into her recliner, local news droning. A story about Movement Festival preparations. Another about construction on I-94. Normal Tuesday night in metro Detroit.</p>

      <p>Forty minutes later, a warmth spread through her chest. Not unpleasant, just unexpected. Like the beginning of a hot flash but different. Her mouth felt dry.</p>

      <p>She stood for water and the room tilted. Not spinning—shifting, like the foundation had moved two inches left. She gripped the counter. Her heart was doing something strange. Not racing exactly, but stuttering, like a car engine misfiring.</p>

      <p>"This is normal," she said aloud. "Rachel said it might feel weird at first."</p>

      <p>But her hands were shaking now. Fine tremors that made her wedding ring tick against the counter. The warmth in her chest had become heat, spreading up her neck, into her skull. Her vision prismed at the edges.</p>

      <p>She needed her phone. Call Rachel. But her legs wouldn't coordinate. She made it three steps before her knee buckled. The carpet came up fast.</p>

      <p>On the floor, she could see Whiskers' dish. Still had food in it. She'd filled it the morning he died, habit stronger than grief. The kibble had been there two days now.</p>

      <p>Her tongue felt thick. Metallic taste flooding her mouth. This wasn't what Rachel described. This was wrong. This was—</p>

      <p>The seizure hit without warning. Her body rigid, then thrashing. The coffee table jumped with each convulsion. The remote fell, changing channels—shopping network, weather, static.</p>

      <p>When it stopped, she couldn't move. Could barely breathe. Just enough strength to turn her head, to see the package on the counter. <em>TR Cannabis.</em> Batch number visible on the label. Tested. Regulated. Safe.</p>

      <p>Her last thought was that Rachel would blame herself.</p>

      <div class="scene-break">* * *</div>

      <p>Rachel started calling at 10 PM. Her mother was usually in bed by nine, but she always answered. The first call went to voicemail. The second. By the third, Rachel was grabbing her keys.</p>

      <p>The twenty-minute drive took fifteen. She used the spare key, calling out as she entered. The TV was on—QVC selling jewelry her mother would never buy.</p>

      <p>She found Dorothy by the recliner. Still warm but wrong, limbs at angles that meant the end had been violent. The gummy package on the counter, one missing.</p>

      <p>Rachel's scream brought neighbors. Then police. Then EMTs who could do nothing but confirm what Rachel already knew.</p>

      <p>By midnight, she was at Detroit Receiving, the same hospital that would be overwhelmed four days later. A tired resident took her statement, catalogued her mother's medications, bagged the gummies as evidence.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Chapter One</h2>

      <p class="timestamp">Detroit — 11:30 p.m.</p>
      <p class="scene">First Clusters · Movement Festival, Hart Plaza</p>

      <p>Movement Festival throbbed at Hart Plaza, the kind of spring night Detroiters endured five months of gray slush for. Cool air drifted off the river, carrying fryer grease, the metallic tang of food-cart oil, and the sour tang of spilled beer. Lasers lanced upward from the stage, ricocheting off the Renaissance Center’s black glass and skittering across a low ceiling of clouds like thrown knives. The DJ’s set — a Berlin import with a reputation and a contract — pushed the bass deep enough to make pockets of teeth vibrate. Twenty thousand bodies moved as one organism: shoulders glistened, glitter winked under the lights, eyes closed like prayer, hands slicing the air.</p>

      <p>It looked like heaven. It smelled like the river and fast food and spilled sweat.</p>

      <p>The first collapse barely registered. South barricade, next to the kettlecorn stand. A man dropped, his legs folding out from under him, and his friends poured bottled water over his head while security waved them away. The guard’s voice was already hoarse from hours of saying the same five phrases to a thousand people. Heat exhaustion, he thought. Happens every year.</p>

      <p>Two minutes later, east rail, a girl went down, then sat up laughing, then vomited hard enough to spatter the shoes of the stranger who caught her. He guided her toward the med tent. She waved him off and vanished into the crowd, leaving a trail of glitter.</p>

      <p>Across the plaza, dispatch traffic started to stack. Medic units were already thin; Detroit never had enough of anything on a good day. “We’ll send somebody,” dispatch said, and meant it, and also knew the somebody might be twenty minutes away.</p>

      <p>At the north gate, a medic cupped his hand to the radio and listened. “Ford’s diverting,” came a voice, thin and strangled. “Repeat: Henry Ford is diverting.”</p>

      <p>“Then where do you want them?” the medic snapped. The young woman he was bagging convulsed again in place, saliva flecking her cheek. “Pick a hospital, Dispatch. We’re dying out here.”</p>

      <p>Back at Unit Twelve, the partner popped an empty naloxone ampule into the trash and shook his head. “Last dose,” he said. “We’re dry.”</p>

      <p>The medic didn’t look up. “Keep bagging. Switch tanks if you have to.”</p>

      <p>“Tank’s at a quarter.”</p>

      <p>“We’ll swap at the rig — if we can find the rig.”</p>

      <p>A livestreamer shouted into a phone: “Dude, they’re doing this fake mass casualty thing for content.” A girl laughed nearby and shoved up against an EMT’s shoulder. He jabbed a finger at her and hissed, “Move.”</p>
