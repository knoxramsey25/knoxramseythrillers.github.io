      <p class="scene">Detroit Riverfront — Movement Electronic Music Festival</p>

      <p>The bass didn’t thump so much as rearrange bones. Tens of thousands moved as a single organism—breathing in time, hands up, phones up, light scattering across a river that looked clean at night. The first collapse barely dented the rhythm. One body, then another; friends lowered them gently, assuming heat, dehydration, a thing you could fix with water and shade.</p>

      <p>Med tents took them in fast—intake, vitals, fluids. Except numbers wouldn’t line up. Heart rates that shouldn’t have been that low. Blood pressure that shouldn’t have held that steady. EMTs adjusted protocols, then adjusted again, because the tool that always worked didn’t.</p>

      <p>From the stage, lasers sliced a grid into the night. Far across the river, a container ship’s horn bellowed once and kept moving. Detroit knew how to carry on.</p>

      <p>Inside the command trailer, a volunteer nurse practitioner stared at a whiteboard <em>that refused to behave like a whiteboard</em>. Tally marks drifted toward a pattern, then slipped as new information fell into place. She was still looking when her radio crackled: three more down along the east gate, a cluster that hadn’t been a cluster until now.</p>

      <p>Ten miles away, a monitoring dashboard blinked a message it had never been programmed to display: <strong>trace.lot C-12 / Bay 3</strong>. A trendline eased past normal and found a new equilibrium where no one expected to find one. That line wasn’t on a hospital monitor. It wasn’t in a med tent. It was in a cold, humming room full of stainless pipe and quietly competent pumps.</p>

      <p>By the time the crowd realized the set had ended early, Detroit’s riverfront was ringed in red and blue. The news choppers were almost polite about the altitude they chose. From above, the festival grounds looked like a printed circuit.</p>

      <p>At street level, the pattern finally resolved into a shape—thin as a hair, strong as a cable—running through pallets and trucks and coolers and screens. Where it started was nobody’s problem. Where it ended was about to be everybody’s.</p>

    <!-- CHAPTER ONE -->
    <section id="ch1" class="card">
      <h2 class="title">Chapter One</h2>

      <p><strong>Knox Ramsey</strong> silenced the dashboard warning and waited for the trend to tell the truth. Processes didn’t fail the way manuals pretended they did. They stuttered. They lied. Somewhere between a sensor and a database, a number started telling a story that didn’t line up with physics—and Knox had built a career finding which sentence was the lie.</p>

      <p>On his screen, the overnight telemetry for three regional cross-dock hubs traced a tidy sine wave: expected thermal cycling as drivers loaded pallets in slices of night. On top of the wave, a thin green thread labeled <em>EC Proxy</em> wandered like a drunk tourist looking for a hotel. Knox leaned in. <span class="subtle">No, not drunk.</span> <em>Guided</em>.</p>

      <p>He pulled a day’s worth of product genealogy and skimmed the hashes. The lot IDs that should have looked like a television snowstorm arranged themselves into a faint diagonal. Coincidences liked to arrive dressed as diagonals. He told himself he was too old to enjoy the shiver and enjoyed it anyway.</p>

      <p>“Show me cold-chain continuity for C-12,” he said to no one. The query compiled, parceled, returned a lattice of locations and timestamps. <strong>Bay 3</strong> flashed yellow.</p>

      <p>The apartment was quiet except for the fridge and the highway and the cheap fan that refused to die. Knox lived like a man who could leave quickly: dishes washed and stacked, backpack near the door, shoes pointing the right direction. The only mess in the room was the one on the screen.</p>

      <p>He thumbed the phone and called a night supervisor he trusted. “Tina, sorry to hit you at this hour.”</p>

      <p>“You always say that, Knox, and you’re never sorry.” She was laughing. On background he heard the echo of forklifts and a radio that wouldn’t stay at a comfortable volume.</p>

      <p>“Bay Three. I need eyes on the manifold for the nutrient blend. Anyone bump the service panel?”</p>

      <p>A pause, the sound of walking, a door, the hollowness of a bigger room. “Panels sealed. Torque paint still intact.”</p>

      <p>“Okay. Run a local pH check on the return line. Don’t trust the HMI.”</p>

      <p>Another pause. “Six point seven.”</p>

      <p>Too high by a hair. Harmless to a human. Not harmless to a root system engineered to live its best life between 5.8 and 6.2. The difference between healthy and unhappy could look like nothing for a day and then everything at once.</p>

      <p>“I want you to hold C-12 for QA,” Knox said. “Don’t ship anything on that pallet set without my sign-off.”</p>

      <p>“You’re going to make me tell dispatch no. You owe me a coffee.”</p>

      <p>“I’ll owe you two.” He ended the call and stared at the green thread that had started this. It didn’t spike. It meandered. He ran a cross-correlation against driver routes and got back a mild maybe. He swapped in weather data, traffic incidents, even the Tigers’ home schedule because he’d learned long ago that causality was a practical joker. The meander stayed a meander.</p>

      <p>He should have wanted sleep. Instead he wanted the truth. He pushed from the chair and walked the small rectangle of the apartment, counting steps without meaning to. When he sat again he wasn’t any smarter, but the part of his brain that liked rhythms was satisfied.</p>

      <p>Knox called a second number. It rang twice. “Ramsey,” said the voice. Flat. Tired. Government.</p>

      <p>“Got a thing,” Knox said. “Not a fire. A smell of smoke. You hearing anything from EMS near the riverfront?”</p>

      <p>“We hear everything. Define your smoke.”</p>

      <p>He defined it in layers: the drift, the diagonal, the pH. He didn’t say Detroit yet. He didn’t say Movement. He didn’t say the word <em>vector</em>, because he knew how quickly that word could rearrange rooms.</p>

      <p>The voice on the line stopped being tired. “You’re suggesting what, exactly?”</p>

      <p>“That someone’s playing with dials people don’t know exist,” Knox said. “If I’m wrong, I buy everyone breakfast and take the L. If I’m right, you want to know before sunrise.”</p>

      <p>Silence. Then: “Text me the hubs. And, Ramsey—don’t call them <em>attacks</em>.”</p>

      <p>He hung up and texted anyway. The screen glowed over a city that was pretending to be asleep. Knox watched the tiny read receipts flip from <em>delivered</em> to <em>seen</em> and felt the familiar mix of relief and regret that came every time he handed a problem to people who could either fix it or bury it.</p>

      <p>He reopened the dashboard and dug into the lot genealogy from the other side—backward from the store to the hub to the cross-dock to the farm, unspooling time. Somewhere in the unspooling he found the thing he hadn’t known to look for: not a missing packet, but an extra one. A heartbeat that didn’t belong.</p>

      <p>He smiled, but it wasn’t a happy smile. Someone who knew the system had found a way to make it sing a note only certain ears could hear. If that someone had chosen to be cruel, there were simpler ways. Which meant this wasn’t about chaos. It was about control.</p>

      <p>His phone vibrated on the desk. A message: <em>EMS surge near Hart Plaza. Unconfirmed cause. Stay available.</em></p>

      <p>Knox Ramsey had tried more than once to stop being available. It had never stuck. He saved the query, grabbed the backpack, and killed the fan so it would have one more day in it. On the way out the door he checked the numbers again. The line that had wandered settled half a notch higher and pretended it had always lived there.</p>

      <p>“Liar,” he said to the screen, and left to go argue with a city.</p>
